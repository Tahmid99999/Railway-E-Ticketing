#### ABOUT: <br/>

***Railway transportation has a conventional notion of being more cost-effective, environment-friendly
and less cumbersome than other modes of transportation all over the world. Bangladesh Railway
introduced an e-ticketing service in 2012 along with other innovative features such as SMS ticketing,
rail tracking system and information display system. Railway E-Ticketing is a service from which
passengers can easily process their train ticket reservation & the administration of train service can
easily control their time schedule and update the current train list. While there are various ways to
build complex functionality-contained applications, our railway e-ticketing only focuses on passenger
& administrator’s advantages.***
